<h1>Miles's, Past, Present, and Future</h1>

<h2>Past</h2>

<p>I was born on January 28 2001 in Mexico City. I left Mexico when I was about 6 months old to go live in Franc,e. My Dad works for Michelin so I went to an International schools where most kids parents worked for Michelin. Thn I left when I was about 4 and moved to Greenville. I stayed in Greenville till I was in about 2nd grade when I moved to Stoke-on-Trent in England. That move was probably the most influential on me as my life would be completly different if I didn't live there. There I made a bunch of friends and started to play <a href="http://www.stokecityfc.com/">football</a>. Then in 6th grade I moved back to Greenville where I still live.</p>
